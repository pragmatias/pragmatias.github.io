      <description>Start How to use image ???
From all of us to all of you, a very Merry Christmas &amp;ndash; and Hugo 0.53!
The main new features in this release are:
Config Dir: You can now split your configuration sections into directories per environment. Hugo did support multiple configuration files before this release, but it was hard to manage for bigger sites, especially those with multiple languages. With this we have also formalized the concept of an environment; the defaults are production (when running hugo) or development (when running hugo server) but you can create any environment you like.</description>
